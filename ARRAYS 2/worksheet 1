Question 1: Explain what an array is in C++.
Ans: An array is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations. It is a fixed-size, homogeneous collection of values that can be accessed by an index.
Question 2: Write the syntax to declare an array of 10 integers.
Ans: int arr[10];
Question 3: Declare an array of 5 floats.
Ans: float arr[10];
Question 4: Initialize an array of 3 characters with values 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
Ans: char arr[]={'a','b','c'};
Question 5: Declare and initialize an array of 4 integers with values 1, 2, 3, and 4 in one statement.
Ans: int arr[4]={1,2,3,4};
Question 6: Given an array int arr[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};, write the code to access and print the third element.
Ans: #include <iostream>
      int main() {
    int arr[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    cout<< "The third element is: " << arr[2] <<endl;
    return 0;
}
